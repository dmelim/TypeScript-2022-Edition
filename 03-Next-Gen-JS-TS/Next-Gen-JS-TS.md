# Let and Const

> `Const` and `Let`

We should not use var. Because it only knows Func and Global scope. Let works with block scope (Also works with if's for exp)

# Arrow Functions

> `const func = () => {}`

# Default Functions Parameters

> `const add = (a, b=5) => a+b`

# The spread operator

> `...Array`

This pulls all the values of an array into a list of values.

# Rest Parameters

We can use the `...Array` spread operator syntax in a function as an argument to accept any number of arguments.

# Array and object Destructuring

> `const [hobby1] = array` in the array the values are extracted by order.

> `const {property} = object` in objects not.
